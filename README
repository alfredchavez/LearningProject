This project uses Reinforcement learning trying to solve a problem of product acquisition.
As requirement you just need Standard Python 2.7

Run it like this
$ python2.7 main.py

The characteristics of the algorithm need to be specified in the configuration file "config.json"
The data must be specified in a csv file, this csv file has the following structure:
    - Provider name, product, cost
The randomcsv.py file is just an auxiliary script that creates a csv file for test, it uses
random name generation from https://gist.github.com/noxan/5845351.
